0;34-41;Surgical Gesture Classification from Video Data;Haro, Zappella, Vidal;2012;"y/""we propose and evaluate three approaches to surgical gesture classification from video.""";Surgical gestures;What is the aim/task of the article? (quote);"""Most of the prior work on surgical gesture recognition (see, e.g., [4-6]) uses hidden Markov models (HMMs) to analyze kinematic data stored by the robot (…) Overall, our main conclusion is that methods based on video data perform equally well as methods based n kinematic data for a typical surgical training setup.""";26;1999-2012;2002, 2001, 2008, 2005, 2009, 2011, 2009, 2006, 2012, 2010, 2012, 2011, 2003, 2009, 2002, 2000, 1999, 2005, 1008, 2009, 2009, 2009, 2001;"""In the first one, we model each video clip from each surgical gesture as the output of a linear dynamical system (LDS) and use metrics in the space of LDSs to classify new video clips. In the second one, we use spatio-temporal features extracted from each video clip to learn a dictionary of spatio-temporal words and use a bag-of-features (BoF) approach to classify new video clips. In the third approach, we use multiple kernel learning to combine the LDS and BoF approaches.""";"""The performance is measured as the percentage of correctly identified surgemes averaged over all tests and repetitions for each setup""";"n/There is no mention of segmentation, but the article does write: ""We assume that each video is segmented into video surgemes"", so the segmentation has been done prior to the work in this article. Later they write: ""the data was manually segmented based on the surgeme's definition of [3].""";"y/""For our tests we used the California dataset [3].""";"""The dataset consists of three different tasks: suturing (SU, 39 trials), needle passing (NP, 26 trials) and knot tying (KT, 36 trials). Each task is performed by 8 surgeons with different skill levels.""";"Private/There is no mention of a public dataset, and the article writes ""The authors thank Intuitive Surgical and Carol Reiley for providing the dataset""";n/Upon searching for the dataset nothing has been found, other than the article referenced;"n/no mention of demographics, though the article does specify that ""Each task is performed by 8 surgeons with different skill levels""";n/the article contains no mention of intent of data collection;"y/""This work was funded by NSF grants 0931805 and 0941362, and by the Talentia Fellowships Programme of the Andalusian Regional Ministry of Economy, Innovation and Science""";n/ the article contains no information about the surgeons in the dataset or the patients they were presumably operating on;n/the focus of the article is to promote a new method, mode of analysis, and does not mention any risk or benefit other than the usefulness of this new method;n/there is no mention of this;n/the article has no mention of this;n
