* or something adjacent to help further my understanding of issues 
* want to finish up part 1 


#### Where do you need help from Veronica?

* What did Veronika mean in the Abbassi text? Could only find “Papers were included if they focused on the diagnosis of detection of abnormalities”.
 (Talk about methodology, titles with detection, classification and prediction)
* How precisely are we interested in the method used?
* Finding performance measures difficult, also a question of precision, and a lack of knowledge
* Private/public datasets is also a tricky one, not something specified, or a measure used in 2012? How to parse this?

#### Any other topics
