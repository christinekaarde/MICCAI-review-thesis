### Date: 12 September 2022

Getting enough articles read through to give me a better understanding of what I'm dealing with, current trouble areas

#### Where do you need help from Veronika?

* What did Veronika mean in the Abbassi text? Could only find “Papers were included if they focused on the diagnosis of detection of abnormalities”.
 (Talk about methodology, titles with detection, classification and prediction)
* How precisely are we interested in the method used?
* Finding performance measures difficult, also a question of precision, and a lack of knowledge
* Private/public datasets is also a tricky one, not something specified, or a measure used in 2012? How to parse this?
