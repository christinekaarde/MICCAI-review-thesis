- What helped you this week?
- Getting enough articles read through to give me a better understanding of what I'm dealing with, current trouble areas
- What did you achieve?
- Annotated a further 8 articles this week
- What did you struggle with?
- Understanding if datasets mentioned in articles are private/public
- What would you like to work on next week?
- Think this depends on what Veronika and I discuss during our meeting today. Have almost gone through part 1 of the conference papers, so have part 2 and 3 to work on, or something adjacent to help further my understanding of issues if that makes more sense. Do want to finish up part 1 though. 
- Where do you need help from Veronika?
- Have compiled a list of questions:
 --What did Veronika mean in the Abbassi text? Could only find “Papers were included if they focused on the diagnosis of detection of abnormalities”.
 (Talk about methodology, titles with detection, classification and prediction)
 --How precisely are we interested in the method used?
 --Finding performance measures difficult, also a question of precision, and a lack of knowledge
 --Private/public datasets is also a tricky one, not something specified, or a measure used in 2012? How to parse this?
